  <div>Hong Kong's vanity plates, better known locally as personalized vehicle registration marks (PVRM), are auctioned at the starting price of HK$ 5000, and first became available in 2006. They are the ultimate car accessory: nonessential, highly individual show off license plates that are personalized to highlight their owner\'s status, wealth or tongue-in-cheek humour. Here is where the idea of creating street poetry came up. The poems are the result of the combination of the car plates. An archive of hundreds of car plate pictures will be the source of inspiration for poets to interpret and create street poems and rhyumes. The poems will be shown on Instagram, each of them in a video post, and they will be part of an exhibition with a live performance.</div>
